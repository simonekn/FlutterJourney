# FlutterJourney
ğŸš€ Welcome to the FlutterJourney repository! ğŸš€
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is my personal space as I embark on an exciting learning adventure with Flutter, with gratitude to the wonderful instructors at [Dio (Digital Innovation One)](https://www.dio.me/en) and the support of the [Santander Scholarships program](https://www.becas-santander.com/pt_br/index.html). 
Join me as I explore the world of mobile app development using this incredible framework. 

ğŸ“š What to Expect:
- A collection of Flutter projects as I practice and progress.
- Updates and improvements as I gain experience and knowledge.
- An opportunity to learn alongside me, whether you're a fellow learner or an experienced Flutter developer.
